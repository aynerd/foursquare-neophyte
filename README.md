This app was created in line with the leadership of Foursquare VGC, Lagos Nigeria's vision for the automated running of as many church processes as possible. This app was designed specially to handle the task of registering visitors to the church. It collects their personal data such as their names, email addresses and phone numbers and allows for the data to be exported as comma seperated values (CSV). The app also keeps a history of whatever data is entered and that makes it useful for generating attendance stats and helping the church determine its impact on the people in her environs.
